`spaghetti-cutter` is a command line tool for CI/CD pipelines (and dev machines)
that helps to cut Go spaghetti code (a.k.a. big ball of mud) into manageable pieces
(and keep it that way).

## Usage

It is strongly recommended to use the `spaghetti-cutter` with a JSON
configuration file `.spaghetti-cutter.json` in the root directory of your
repository.
